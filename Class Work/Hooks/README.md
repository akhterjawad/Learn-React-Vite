# React + Vite
<p>The `useState` hook in React is used to manage state in functional components. It allows you to add state to your components, making them dynamic and interactive. With `useState`, you can easily track and update variables like user inputs, toggles, or counters, ensuring your UI stays responsive and up-to-date as the state changes.</p><br />
<p>The `useRef` hook in React allows you to persist values between renders without causing a re-render when the value changes. It's commonly used to access and manipulate DOM elements directly or to store mutable values that don't trigger re-renders. On the other hand, the `useState` hook is used to manage and track state within a component, causing the component to re-render whenever the state changes, making it essential for handling dynamic data in your React application.</p><br />
<p>The `useEffect` hook in React allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, updating the DOM, or setting up subscriptions. It runs after every render by default, but you can control its execution by passing dependencies, making it powerful for managing component lifecycle events. The `useState` hook, on the other hand, is used to add state to functional components, enabling you to keep track of and update values that change over time, like form inputs or component visibility.</p><br />
